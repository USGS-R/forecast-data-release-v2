  <p>XX [MODIFY, leaving old text in here for an example] Observations related to water and thermal budgets in the Delaware River Basin. Data from reservoirs in the basin include
  reservoir characteristics (e.g., bathymetry), daily water levels, daily depth-resolved water temperature observations, 
  and daily inflows, diversions, and releases. Data from streams in the basin include daily flow and temperature observations.  
  Data were compiled from a variety of sources to cover the modeling period (1980-2021), including the National Water Inventory System, 
  Water Quality Portal, EcoSHEDS stream water temperature database, ReaLSAT, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) or zipped csv. 
  
  
  <p>XX [MODIFY, leaving old text in here for an example] For modeling purposes, we sought to create a test set of flow and temperature observations that were representative of 
  dynamics throughout the Delaware River basin from water year 1980-present. Test holdouts are documented in the 
  flow and temperature files. To minimize the possibility of the correlation 
  between sites and temporal autocorrelation at single sites causing artificially high test performance, we created temporal 
  holdouts (time periods where data from all sites were reserved for testing), and spatial holdouts (sites where all data were 
  reserved for testing). In all, this resulted in a train/test split of 66.2%/33.8% for observed temperature reach days, 
  and 71.4%/28.6% for observed flow reach days. 
  
  
  <p>XX [MODIFY, leaving old text in here for an example] For temporal holdouts: All data in the water years 1980-84, 2011-15, and 2021 were reserved for the test set. 
  These windows were chosen to attempt to balance the ability to test on the most recent data (critical to assess 
  performance in an operational setting) and historical periods, while still training on a sufficient amount of 
  modern continuous data. For spatial holdouts: We chose eight reaches of the PRMS network to reserve all data for testing, 
  based on representing key parts of the Delaware basin (mainstem, headwaters, reservoir-adjacent reaches), representing 
  the distribution catchment attributes (e.g. fraction of impervious surfaces) and minimizing the number of observations 
  within a 20 km distance along the network ('fish radius').

    data-name: temperature_observations_{subset}.zip
    data-description: >- 
      Daily water temperature observations with sites matched to model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
      Files represent various subsets of similar data, and are either sites matched to any of the 456 segments (temperature_observations_drb.zip), 
      sites matched to a subset of 56 river segments above the
      Delaware River at Lordville, NY (temperature_observations_lordville.zip), or at the 5 priority forecast sites.
      Water temperature observations were compiled from NWIS, EcoSHEDS, and WQP. If multiple sites were matched to a single
      river reach and had measurements on the same day, the values were averaged.
   
      Temperature observations for five priority forecasting sites in the Delaware River Basin
      were first pulled from NWIS, and remaining data gaps in the modeling period
      were filled if there was data available from other sources (WQP or EcoSHEDS).

      attr-def:  >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier which was created in order to split segments such that 
        segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches. The ID was created
        using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}).

        Matches were limited to a 500m buffer of the monitoring site. The reach number is from the field "nsegment_v1_1" in the 
        Geospatial Fabric for the National Hydrologic Model v1.1.
        
        
        Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the 
        upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach. 
        If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match was kept.

      Reservoir release data was provided by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC DEP). 
      Gaps in the NYC DEP data were filled by extracting data from the U.S. Geological Survey Office of the Delare River Basin 
      reports that can be found at https://webapps.usgs.gov/odrm/data/data.html. Release values are total release volumes,
      such that the different release types from file reservoir_releases_by_type.csv were summed by reservoir-date.
