  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p>Daily maximum water temperature predictions in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) can inform decision
  makers who can use cold-water reservoir releases to maintain thermal habitat for sensitive fish species. 
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models
  that makes predictions at 70 river reaches in the upper Delaware River Basin. The modeling approach
  includes process-guided deep learning and data assimilation (Zwart et al., 2022). The model is
  driven by weather forecasts and observed reservoir releases and produces maximum water temperature forecasts
  for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7).
  
  In combination with data provided in Oliver et al. (2022), this release contains all data used to train and validate
  the water temperature forecast models. This includes a process-based model pre-trainer, forecasted gridded weather data,
  reservoir releases, and water temperature data. Additionally, this release contains predictions from three models: a
  deep learning model, a deep learning model with data assimilation, and a persistence model. 
  Additionally, this release contains a tidy version of the model predictions with paired observations for easier reuse.

  <br/>The data are organized into 4 child folders: 1) Spatial information, 2) model driver data, 3) model configuration files, 4) model predictions data </p>
