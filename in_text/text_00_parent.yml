  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p>Daily temperature predictions in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) can inform decision makers who can use cold-water reservoir releases to maintain thermal habitat for sensitive fish and mussel species. 
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models that made real-time predictions in the
  Delaware River Basin during 2022. The model is driven by weather forecasts and observed reservoir releases and produces maximum water temperature forecasts
  for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7) at five sites.
  
  This data release captures the entire forecasting period that is reported in Zwart et al. 2022, and is an extension of a previous data
  release that contains all data needed to build these models but only extends to MM DD, 2022 (Oliver et al. 2021). 
  Additionally, this release contains a tidy version of the model predictions with paired observations for easier reuse.

  <br/>The data are organized into 4 child folders: 1) Spatial information, 2) model driver data, 3) model configuration files, 4) model predictions data </p>
