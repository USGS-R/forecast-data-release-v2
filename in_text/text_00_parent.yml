  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p>[from Last year's summary of the release] This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models that made real-time
  predictions in the Delaware River Basin during 2021. The model is driven by weather forecasts and observed reservoir releases and produces
  maximum water temperature forecasts for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7) at five sites.
  
  This data release captures the entire forecasting period that is reported in Zwart et al. 2022, and is an extension of a previous data
  release that contains all data needed to build these models but only extends to MM DD, 2022 (Oliver et al. 2021). 
  Additionally, this release contains a tidy version of the model predictions with paired observations for easier reuse.

build-environment: Multiple computer operating systems were used to generate these data, including Windows, linux, OSX. The open source languages R and Python were used on all systems.
