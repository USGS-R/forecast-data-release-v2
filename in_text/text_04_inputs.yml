      sntemp_inputs_outputs_{subset}.zip
    data-description: >-
      PRMS-SNTemp inputs and outputs, including weather driver data, intermediate varibles, and
      model predictions. There are two files; files either contain inputs/outputs from all 456 stream reaches in the
      Delaware River Basin modeling network, or for the 56 segments above Lordville, New York.

      
      Code used to generate these inputs and outputs can be found in the repository "run-prms-sntemp" in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).

      
      There are two error codes in PRMS-SNTemp v5.1.0_rc that can be present in the
      seg_tave_water and seg_tave_upstream attributes indicating no streamflow for the current
      timestep (error code: -98.9) or no streamflow at any timestep (error code: -99.9) of the model run.
      Stream segments that never have streamflow (-99.9) do not have any hydrologic reach units and do not have any upstream segments to produce
      streamflow, and consequently never be able to simulate stream temperature. Segments with
      contributing hydrologic reach units and/or upstream segments can have streamflow but
      may not have streamflow at the current timestep (-98.9)

      
      Very negative groundwater and shallow subsurface water temperatures (e.g. less than -1 C) are
      not error codes, but rather are a product of the way this version of PRMS-SNTemp is coded. However,
      we advise against using these very low groundwater and shallow subsurface temperature values
      as they likely are far from actual water temperatures.

    data-description: >-
      Daily reservoir water budget components calculated for Pepacton and Cannonsville Reservoirs.
      When monthly values were available, we interpolated down to daily values which is tracked in
      the column named data_type. Data were compiled from USGS New York Water Data Reports (e.g., https://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/wdr/wdrny051/) and
      reservoir operation data from the Office of the Delaware River Master (e.g., https://webapps.usgs.gov/odrm/documents/tables/jun2013.pdf).


      Note that these data are not collected by USGS, and elevation record and capacity table were provided by New York City Department of Environmental Protection.

      NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System v12.0 0.25-degree operational model output for the 00 UTC forecast cycle from 2021-04-15 to 2021-07-16.
      These data are aggregated to the daily scale and NOAA GEFS grid cells are matched to the centroid of the target stream segment. The target stream segment
      seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.

      
      The zipped folder contains one NetCDF file per forecast issue date evaluated in Zwart and others 2021, such
      that the file name is final_noaa_gefs_{extent}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_00_forecast_segments.segments.nc. Archiving of the NOAA GEFS
      product was changed from USGS NGWOS priority basins early in the record (extent = NGWOS) to the continental U.S. starting
      on 2021-05-26 which is reflected in the name change (extent = CONUS).


      Example code for how read the NOAA GEFS .nc files can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).
