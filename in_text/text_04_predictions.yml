  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 4) model predictions

abstract: >-
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models
  that makes predictions at 70 river reaches in the upper Delaware River Basin. This section includes
  predictions from several models, including a model pre-trainer that is predictions from a distance-weighted-average
  lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN) model, reservoir outlet temperature predictions from a process-based model,
  and three data-driven water temperature forecast models.

    data-name: dwallin_stream_preds.csv.zip
    data-description: >-
      Stream temperature predictions from the distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN).
      Predictions were generated from a combination of lotic (from PRMS-SNTemp) and lentic (GLM) models.
      See Oliver et al. 2021 for processing steps that were taken to calculate the DWALLIN stream temperature 
      predictions.
  
      There were a few site-dates with extremely high predicted stream temperature values.
      These high values are a product of the way PRMS-SNTemp v5.1.0_rc was coded and are likely
      a result of stream segments with little or no upstream inflow and very little in-stream
      flow for that particular day leading to extremely high temperature predictions under those conditions.
      Subsequent versions of PRMS-SNTemp will resolve these extreme values, and we suggest against using
      stream temperature predictions above 35 degrees C, which occurs 4 times in this dataset.

      Forecasts of daily maximum stream temperature for 70 locations in the upper Delaware River Basin issued from 2019-01-03 to 2019-12-23 for the validation period and 
      2021-04-18 to 2022-09-22 for the testing period. 
      Five zip folders comprise the forecasts, split by model type - either lstm-DA, lstm-noDA, rgcn-DA, or rgcn-noDA.
      The target stream segment seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.
      
      Forecasts were generated with a 1) persistence model that propagating the most recent observed maximum temperature 7 days into
      the future, 2) a deep learning model, and a 3) deep learning
      model with data assimilation. Code that trained the deep learning models and 
      generated the forecasts can be found in the "run-pgdl-da " repository in Zwart et al. 2023.
      
      The zipped files contain 50 or 52 files per model type named {hash}_{model-type}_GMM_{seed}_{val-or-test}_forecast.{nc-or-xml}.
      Each file has two file types (a forecast .nc netCDF file and a .xml metadata file) for each hash, model type, seed, and 
      validation or test period. The hash indicates what spatial cross-validation fold the output is for and the seed 
      represents the random seed used to initialize model training / forecasting. 

      A general description of the attributes is provided below for all the forecasted nc files. 
      No minimum and maximum values are given to capture all forecasted nc files.

process-description: >-
  The distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN) model combines
  predictions from two process-based models to represent both stream and reservoir processes.
  The stream model is a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC. PRMS is a
  deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use, and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of
  changes in hydrology and energy. The reservoir model is the open source General Lake Model (GLM) version 3.1. GLM is a one-dimensional dynamical model which simplifies lakes using a vertical approximation,
  where horizontal variability is ignored. GLM uses a Lagrangian approach to layer structure where layers can split and combine based on changing vertical gradients.
  GLM is a modern, implementation of other one-dimensional models.
