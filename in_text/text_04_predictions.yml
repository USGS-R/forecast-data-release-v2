    data-name: dwallin_stream_preds.csv.zip
    data-description: >-
      Stream temperature predictions from the distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN).
      Predictions were generated from a combination of lotic (from PRMS-SNTemp) and lentic (GLM) models.
      See dwallin_functions.R for processing steps that were taken to calculate the DWALLIN stream temperature
      predictions.
  
      There a few site-dates with extremely high predicted stream temperature values.
      These high values are a product of the way PRMS-SNTemp v5.1.0_rc was coded and are likely
      a result of stream segments with little or no upstream inflow and very little in-stream
      flow for that particular day leading to extreamly high temperature predictions under those conditions.
      Subsequent versions of PRMS-SNTemp will resolve these extreme values, and we suggest against using
      stream temperature predictions above 35 degrees C, which occurs 7 times in this dataset.

    data-name: forecast_pgdl_da_outputs.zip
    data-description: >-
      Forecasts of daily maximum stream temperature for five select locations in the Delaware River Basin issued from 2022-XX-XX to 2022-XXXX.
      The target stream segment seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.
      
      Forecasts were generated with a 1) persistence model that used the most recent observed daily
      maximum temperature as the 7-day ahead forecast, 2) a deep learning model, and a 3) deep learning
      model with data assimilation. Code that trained the deep learning models can be found in the "run-pgdl-da " repository,
      and code that generated the forecasts can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).
      
      The zipped folder contains 60 files per issue date named forecast[{YYYY-MM-DD}]_files.zip.
      Each issue date has two file types (a forecast .nc netCDF file and a .xml metadata file) for each model 
      (DA, no_DA, persistence {model}), stream segment (1571, 1573, 1641, 1565, 1450 {seg_id_nat}),
      and reservoir release scenario (0cfs or 100cfs {scenario}) such that files are named
      lstm_seg_id_nat_[{seg_id_nat}]_{model}_forecast_[{YYYY-MM-DD}]_release[{scenario}].
      
      Since observations of daily maximum stream temperature were not available when we issued
      the forecast, the persistence forecast files have NA's for the daily maximum stream temperature
      prediction. When evaluating the performance of the persistence forecasts against the
      deep learning models, we use yesterday's maximum temperature value as the forecast for
      7 days into the future. See the evaluation code in the "evaluate-forecast" repository in
      Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910) for this adjustment [TO UPDATE with new Zenodo link].

      data assimilation had 3100 ensembles, and reported predictions
      are the mean of the ensembles. The persistence model was generated
      by propagating yesterday's observed maximum temperature 7 days into
      the future. The DA and no_DA models were used to make predictions for
      two scenarios: the observed researvoir release values (+0cfs) and
      a scenario where a manager increased the releases by 100cfs (+100cfs).
      For the +100 cfs scenario, we did not pair observervations with predictions.

process-description: >-
  The distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN) model combines
  predictions from two process-based models to represent both stream and reservoir processes.
  The stream model is a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC. PRMS is a
  deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use, and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of
  changes in hydrology and energy. The reservoir model is the open source General Lake Model (GLM) version 3.1. GLM is a one-dimensional dynamical model which simplifies lakes using a vertical approximation,
  where horizontal variability is ignored. GLM uses a Lagrangian approach to layer structure where layers can split and combine based on changing vertical gradients.
  GLM is a modern, implementation of other one-dimensional models. We used GLM to run individual lake simulations according to the processes described in Winslow and others 2017.
