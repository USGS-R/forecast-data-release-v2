  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 2 model drivers

abstract: >-
  <p>Observations related to water and thermal budgets in the Delaware River Basin. Data from reservoirs in the basin include
  reservoir characteristics (e.g., bathymetry), daily water levels, daily depth-resolved water temperature observations, 
  and daily inflows, diversions, and releases. Data from streams in the basin include daily flow and temperature observations.  
  Data were compiled from a variety of sources to cover the modeling period (1980-2022), including the National Water Inventory System, 
  Water Quality Portal, EcoSHEDS stream water temperature database, ReaLSAT, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) or zipped csv. 
  
  <p For modeling purposes, we sought to create a test set of flow and temperature observations that were representative of 
  dynamics throughout the Delaware River basin from water year 1980-present. Test holdouts are documented in the 
  flow and temperature files. To minimize the possibility of the correlation 
  between sites and temporal autocorrelation at single sites causing artificially high test performance, we created temporal 
  holdouts (time periods where data from all sites were reserved for testing), and spatial holdouts (sites where all data were 
  reserved for testing). In all, this resulted in a train/test split of 66.2%/33.8% for observed temperature reach days, 
  and 71.4%/28.6% for observed flow reach days. 
  
  <p> For temporal holdouts: All data in the water years 1980-84, 2011-15, and 2021 were reserved for the test set. 
  These windows were chosen to attempt to balance the ability to test on the most recent data (critical to assess 
  performance in an operational setting) and historical periods, while still training on a sufficient amount of 
  modern continuous data. For spatial holdouts: We chose eight reaches of the PRMS network to reserve all data for testing, 
  based on representing key parts of the Delaware basin (mainstem, headwaters, reservoir-adjacent reaches), representing 
  the distribution catchment attributes (e.g. fraction of impervious surfaces) and minimizing the number of observations 
  within a 20 km distance along the network ('fish radius').

      A csv file for each reservoir with input meteorological data. Files are named "NLDAS_time[0.367700]_x{x}_y{y}.csv" where the x and y locations are longitude and latitude indices from NLDAS
      of the individual meteorological data cell (data are from Mitchell and others 2004).
      The filename of the NLDAS file associated with each reservoir is listed in the "meteo_fl" fields in reservoir_nml_values.json, which is in the 3_config child item.

        NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System v12.0 0.25-degree operational model output for the 00 UTC forecast cycle from 2022-MM-DD to 2022-MM-DD.
        These data are aggregated to the daily scale and NOAA GEFS grid cells are matched to the centroid of the target stream segment. The target stream segment
        seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.
        
        The noaagefs_meteo_driver_files zipped folder contains one NetCDF file per forecast issue date evaluated in Zwart and others 2021, such
        that the file name is final_noaa_gefs_{extent}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_00_forecast_segments.segments.nc. Archiving of the NOAA GEFS
        product was changed from USGS NGWOS priority basins early in the record (extent = NGWOS) to the continental U.S. starting
        on 2021-05-26 which is reflected in the name change (extent = CONUS).
        Example code for how read the NOAA GEFS .nc files can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).

    #   Water temperature observations were compiled from NWIS, EcoSHEDS, and WQP. If multiple sites were matched to a single

    #   Temperature observations for five priority forecasting sites in the Delaware River Basin

    # data-description: >-
    #   Daily mean flow observation data with sites matched to model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
    #   Data were compiled from the National Water Information System (NWIS). Three subsets of similar data are provided,
    #   including sites from any of the 456 segments (flow_observations_drb.zip), sites from a subset of 56 segments above 
    #   the Delaware River at Lordville, NY (flow_observations_lordville.zip), or the 5 priority forecast sites.

    #   attr-label: seg_id_nat
    #   attr-def: >-
    #     The closest river reach from the Geospatial Fabric v1.1, by Euclidean distance, from the monitoring site. 
    #     Matches were limited to a 500m buffer of the monitoring site. The reach number is from the field "nsegment_v1_1" in the 
    #     Geospatial Fabric for the National Hydrologic Model v1.1.
    #     
    #     
    #     Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the 
    #     upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach. 
    #     If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match was kept.

    #     using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}).

    #   Reservoir release data was provided by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC DEP).

    #   reports that can be found at https://webapps.usgs.gov/odrm/data/data.html. Release values are total release volumes,
    #   such that the different release types from file reservoir_releases_by_type.csv were summed by reservoir-date.
