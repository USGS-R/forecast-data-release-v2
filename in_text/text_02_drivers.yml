  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 2) model driver data 

abstract: >-
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models
  that makes predictions at 70 river reaches in the upper Delaware River Basin. This section contains
  forcing data for water temperature forecasting models reported in Zwart et al. (2022), including a
  process-based pre-trainer, gridded weather and forecasted weather data, and flow and temperature
  for reservoir inlets and outlets.

      NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System v12.0 0.25-degree operational model output for the 00 UTC forecast cycle from 2021-04-25 to 2022-04-18.
      These data are aggregated to the daily scale and NOAA GEFS grid cells are matched to the centroid of the target stream segment. The target stream segment
      seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.
      
      The noaagefs_meteo_driver_files zipped folder contains one NetCDF file per forecast issue date evaluated in Zwart et al. 2022, such
      that the file name is final_noaa_gefs_{extent}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_00_forecast_segments.nc. Archiving of the NOAA GEFS
      product was changed from USGS NGWOS priority basins early in the record (extent = NGWOS) to the continental U.S. starting
      on 2021-05-26 which is reflected in the name change (extent = CONUS).
      Example code for how read the NOAA GEFS .nc files can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2022 (XXlink to zenodo).

   Stream observations and driver data were combined from multiple sources to achieve the most complete temporal coverage possible
  from 1980-2022. Historical weather driver data from NLDAS, GridMET, and NOAA GEFS (in this release and Oliver et al. 2022) were used to
  train the models, while forecasted weather data (NOAA GEFS) was used to evaluate real-time forecasts. Gridded weather
  drivers were aggregated to the reservoir polygons
  and stream polylines included in this release either using grid-to-point intersection or weighted averages of grids that intersected
  a stream reach's hydrologic response units (HRUs). 
  
  
  The modeled flow and temperature in reservoir inlets and outlets (reservoir_io_sntemp.csv) were generated
  using a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC. PRMS is a
  deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use, and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of
  changes in hydrology and energy.
