  Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 1) Waterbody information for 70 river reaches and 2 reservoirs

abstract: >-

  This section provides spatial data files that describe the river and reservoirs in the Delaware River Basin included in this release. One shapefile of polylines
  describes the 70 river reaches that define the modeling network, and another shapefile of polygons includes
  the two reservoirs (Pepacton, Cannonsville) for which data are included in this release.

    data-name: study_stream_reaches.zip
    data-description: >-
      GIS polylines data for the 70 stream segments included in the upper Delaware River Basin that
      have been included in this study. Stream reaches include those on the East and West Branch of the
      Delaware River, mainstem Delaware River reaches above Lordville, New York, and the Neversink River.
      The stream network is a subset of the 456 stream segments available in the study_stream_reaches 
      shapefile (study_stream_reaches.shp) in the associated data release by
      Oliver. et al., 2022 (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e54c4d34e915b67d83580).
      The stream network is originally derived from the USGS Geospatial Fabric v.1.  
    attributes:
    -
      attr-label: subsegid
      attr-def: >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier. This default identifier attribute contains some split segments (suffix `_1`,`_2`) so that each segment start and endpoints are connected with no intersecting reaches.
        The ID was created using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {seg_id}_{index}). There are 70 unique identifiers in this field.
        This feature corresponds to subseg_id in other files.

      attr-label: fromsegs
      attr-def: >-
        Reach identifier (subsegseg) of the upstream segment. NA indicates a headwater stream with no upstream segments.
        Multiple upstream segments are separated with a semicolon.

      attr-label: segidnat
      attr-def: >-
        National stream reach identifier. 
        This is the national segment ID from the Geospatial Fabric for National Hydrologic Modeling.
        This feature corresponds to "seg_id_nat" in other data files. There are 70 unique identifiers in this field.
        While this is not the case for this data subset, please note that several split segments from the study_stream_reaches.shp in Oliver et al., with unique `subsegid` have same `segidnat` (e.g. the `segidnat` for subsegid:`3_1` and subsegid:`3_2` is 1437).

process-description: >-
  The stream network is based on a lightly modified version of the National Geospatial Fabric v1, where some
  modifications were made to meet the criteria that segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches.
  This stream network forms the basis for many other data products, including the summarization of driver data and tying observations
  to the stream network.
