  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  <p>Several models were used to improve water temperature prediction in the Delaware River Basin.

  <p>PRMS-SNTemp was used to predict daily temperatures at 456 stream reaches in the Delaware River Basin.
  Daily stream temperature predictions for inflow and outflow reaches for Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs
  were pulled aside into a separate csv to be used as inputs to the General Lake Model (GLM).
  Reservoir outflow predictions and in-reservoir temperature predictions were generated with
  calibrated models built using GLM v3.1. We calculated a decay rate based on the modeled reservoir
  outflow temperatures and observed downstream river temperature to estimate the decay of the reservoir influence
  on stream temperature as a function of distance downstream of a reservoir. These decay rates from
  Pepacton and Cannonsville were used to weight the predictions from GLM and
  PRMS-SNTemp on the East and West Branch of the Delaware River, respectively, to represent the mix of stream and
  reservoir processes that affect temperature dynamics. These weighted values were then used to pre-train the deep learning
  models that were used to forecast temperature. More details on these methods can be found in Zwart and others 2021.

  <p>Code that generated these results can be found in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).

    data-name: dwallin_stream_preds.csv
    data-description: >-
      Stream temperature predictions from the distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN).
      Predictions were generated from a combination of lotic (from PRMS-SNTemp) and lentic (GLM) models.
      See dwallin_functions.R for processing steps that were taken to calculate the DWALLIN stream temperature
      predictions.
  

      There a few site-dates with extremely high predicted stream temperature values.
      These high values are a product of the way PRMS-SNTemp v5.1.0_rc was coded and are likely
      a result of stream segments with little or no upstream inflow and very little in-stream
      flow for that particular day leading to extreamly high temperature predictions under those conditions.
      Subsequent versions of PRMS-SNTemp will resolve these extreme values, and we suggest against using
      stream temperature predictions above 35 degrees C, which occurs 7 times in this dataset.

    data-name: forecast[2021-04-16_2021-09-30]_files.zip
    data-description: >-
      Forecasts of daily maximum stream temperature for five select locations in the Delaware River Basin issued from 2021-04-16 to 2021-09-30.
      The target stream segment seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.

      
      Forecasts were generated with a 1) persistence model that used the most recent observed daily
      maximum temperature as the 7-day ahead forecast, 2) a deep learning model, and a 3) deep learning
      model with data assimilation. Code that trained the deep learning models can be found in the "run-pgdl-da " repository,
      and code that generated the forecasts can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).

      
      The zipped folder contains 60 files per issue date named forecast[{YYYY-MM-DD}]_files.zip.
      Each issue date has two file types (a forecast .nc netCDF file and a .xml metadata file) for each model 
      (DA, no_DA, persistence {model}), stream segment (1571, 1573, 1641, 1565, 1450 {seg_id_nat}),
      and reservoir release scenario (0cfs or 100cfs {scenario}) such that files are named
      lstm_seg_id_nat_[{seg_id_nat}]_{model}_forecast_[{YYYY-MM-DD}]_release[{scenario}].

      
      Since observations of daily maximum stream temperature were not available when we issued
      the forecast, the persistence forecast files have NA's for the daily maximum stream temperature
      prediction. When evaluating the performance of the persistence forecasts against the
      deep learning models, we use yesterday's maximum temperature value as the forecast for
      7 days into the future. See the evaluation code in the "evaluate-forecast" repository in
      Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910) for this adjustment.
